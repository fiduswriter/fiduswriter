Fidus Writer 
===========

Fidus Writer is an online collaborative editor especially made for academics who need to use citations and/or formulas. The editor focuses on the content rather than the layout, so that with the same text, you can later on publish it in multiple ways: On a website, as a printed book, or as an ebook. In each case, you can choose from a number of layouts that are adequate for the medium of choice.

Howto install
----

The following are instructions working on most *NIX systems.

0. Install the development packages of libjpeg and python and the python virtual environment creator. How you do this depends on your system. On Debian and Ubuntu the packages are called libjpeg-dev, python-dev and python-virtualenv. Install them with your favorite package manager, for example on the command line by running:

  sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev python-dev python-virtualenv

1. Start the command line (terminal).

2. Cd to where you have your sources.

3. You can use the virtualenv command to create virtual environments. The following command will create an environment called "fiduswriter-venv":

  virtualenv  --no-site-packages fiduswriter-venv

4. Activate the virtualenv by typing:

  source fiduswriter-venv/bin/activate

5. Install the requirements for running  fiduswriter by typing:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

6. If you want to go beyond a local test installation, copy configuraiton.py-default to configuration.py, and edit configuration.py with a text editor, adjusting it to fit your needs.

7. Recompile locale message files by typing:

  python manage.py compilemessages

8. Synchronize the DB and create a superuser by typing:

  python manage.py syncdb

  python manage.py migrate

  python manage.py loaddata bibliography/fixture/initial_bib_rules.json
