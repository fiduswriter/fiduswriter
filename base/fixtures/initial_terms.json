The Company's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how the Company's visitors use its website. From time to time, the Company may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.\r\n\r\nThe Company also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on the Website.
