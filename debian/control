Description: Collaborative academic word processor (bundled)
 Fidus Writer is an online collaborative editor especially made for academics

  * Semantic word processing
  * Real-time collaboration
  * Citation management
  * Formula support with LaTeX
  * Multiple export formats (HTML, EPUB, LaTeX, DOCX)
  * Template system

 dependencies bundled in a virtualenv at /opt/fiduswriter/, making it
 self-contained and working on different versions of Ubuntu and Debian
