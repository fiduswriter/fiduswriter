# Fidus Writer Documentation

Welcome to the Fidus Writer documentation! This documentation covers installation, configuration, development, and contributing to Fidus Writer.

## About Fidus Writer

Fidus Writer is an online collaborative editor especially made for academics who need to use citations and/or formulas. The editor focuses on the content rather than the layout, so that with the same text, you can later on publish it in multiple ways: On a website, as a printed book, or as an ebook. In each case, you can choose from a number of layouts that are adequate for the medium of choice.
