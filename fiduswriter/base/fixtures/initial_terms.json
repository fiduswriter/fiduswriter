Your\r\n  stored personal information an content will not be shared with\r\n  any third parties except as necessary to provide the services\r\n  offered.<em>&nbsp;</em>Without limiting any of those\r\n  representations or warranties, the Company has the right (though\r\n  not the obligation) to, in the Company's sole discretion (i)\r\n  refuse or remove any content that, in the Company's reasonable\r\n  opinion, violates any the Company policy or is in any way harmful\r\n  or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of\r\n  the Website to any individual or entity for any reason, in the\r\n  Company's sole discretion.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n  Website Visitors\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  Like most website operators, the Company collects\r\n  non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web\r\n  browsers and servers typically make available, such as the\r\n  browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date\r\n  and time of each visitor request. The Company's purpose in\r\n  collecting non-personally identifying information is to better\r\n  understand how the Company's visitors use its website. From time\r\n  to time, the Company may release non-personally-identifying\r\n  information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on\r\n  trends in the usage of its website.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  The Company also collects potentially personally-identifying\r\n  information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in\r\n  users and for users leaving comments on the Website. The Company\r\n  only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under\r\n  the same circumstances that it uses and discloses\r\n  personally-identifying information as described below, except\r\n  that commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the\r\n  administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n  Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  Certain visitors to the Company's websites choose to interact\r\n  with the Company in ways that require the Company to gather\r\n  personally-identifying information. The amount and type of\r\n  information that the Company gathers depends on the nature of the\r\n  interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at&nbsp;the\r\n  Website&nbsp;to provide a username and email address. Those who\r\n  engage in transactions with the Company are asked to provide\r\n  additional information, including as necessary the personal and\r\n  financial information required to process those transactions. In\r\n  each case, the Company collects such information only insofar as\r\n  is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the\r\n  visitor's interaction with the Company. The Company does not\r\n  disclose personally-identifying information other than as\r\n  described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply\r\n  personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may\r\n  prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n  Aggregated Statistics\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The Company may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors\r\n  to its websites. The Company may display this information\r\n  publicly or provide it to others. However, the Company does not\r\n  disclose personally-identifying information other than as\r\n  described below.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n  Protection of Certain Personally-identifying Information\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The Company discloses potentially personally-identifying and\r\n  personally-identifying information only to those of its\r\n  employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need\r\n  to know that information in order to process it on the Company's\r\n  behalf or to provide services available at the Company's\r\n  websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.\r\n  Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations\r\n  may be located outside of your home country; by using the\r\n  Company's websites, you consent to the transfer of such\r\n  information to them. The Company will not rent or sell\r\n  potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying\r\n  information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors\r\n  and affiliated organizations, as described above, the Company\r\n  discloses potentially personally-identifying and\r\n  personally-identifying information only in response to a\r\n  subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when the\r\n  Company believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably\r\n  necessary to protect the property or rights of the Company, third\r\n  parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of\r\n  an the Company website and have supplied your email address, the\r\n  Company may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new\r\n  features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with\r\n  what's going on with the Company and our products. If you send us\r\n  a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback\r\n  mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help\r\n  us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other\r\n  users. The Company takes all measures reasonably necessary to\r\n  protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or\r\n  destruction of potentially personally-identifying and\r\n  personally-identifying information.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n  Cookies\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a\r\n  visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to\r\n  the website each time the visitor returns. The Company uses\r\n  cookies to help the Company identify and track visitors, their\r\n  usage of the Company website, and their website access\r\n  preferences. The Company visitors who do not wish to have cookies\r\n  placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse\r\n  cookies before using the Company's websites, with the drawback\r\n  that certain features of the Company's websites may not function\r\n  properly without the aid of cookies.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n  Copyright&nbsp;Infringement and DMCA Policy\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  As the Company asks others to respect its intellectual property\r\n  rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others.\r\n  If you believe that material located on or linked to by the\r\n  Website violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify the\r\n  Company in accordance with the Company's Digital Millennium\r\n  Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") Policy. The Company will respond to all\r\n  such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing\r\n  the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing\r\n  material. The Company will terminate a visitor's access to and\r\n  use of the Website if, under appropriate circumstances, the\r\n  visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights\r\n  or other intellectual property rights of the Company or others.\r\n  In the case of such termination, the Company will have no\r\n  obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to\r\n  the Company.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n  Intellectual Property\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  This Agreement does not transfer from the Company to you any the\r\n  Company or third party intellectual property, and all right,\r\n  title and interest in and to such property will remain (as\r\n  between the parties) solely with the Company.
